// How to use the built-in technical functions to perform advanced math that operators cannot do alone


/*  C has built-in math functions that supply the function routine for the desired calculation. Most are highly    
    technical and used for complex math calculations.
    
    ! To use any of the built-in math functions in C, the math.h header file must be listed alongside stdio.h in the preprocessor commands. Also, there's a subset of functions inside math functions called numeric functions that are not so much for calculating, but for converting numbers to and from other numbers.


    NUMERIC FUNCTIONS (Conversion)

            floor()
            - Called floor function
            - E.g. floor(5.8) >>>>  5.0
            * This function also works with negative numbers i.e. -17.5 would go down to -18.0
            - Pushes down non-integers to their next-lower integer values i.e. rounds down to next whole number
            * Although it converts its argument to integer values, the value the function actually returns is a float value and so the conversion character needed when formatting a string in printf() is '%f'.
            - The returned value is what's stored after the conversion

                E.g.

                        lowVal1 = floor(18.5);  //  Stores 18.0
                        lowVal1 = floor(-18.5);  //  Stores -19.0


            ceil()
            - Called ceiling function
            - E.g. ceil(5.3) >>>>  6.0
            * This function also works with negative numbers i.e. -17.5 would go up to -17.0
            - Pushes up non-integers to their next-higher integer values i.e. rounds up to next whole number
            * Although it converts its argument to integer values, the value the function actually returns is a float value and so the conversion character needed when formatting a string in printf() is '%f'.
            - The returned value is what's stored after the conversion

                E.g.

                        highVal1 = ceil(18.5);  //  Stores 19.0
                        highVal1 = ceil(-18.5);  //  Stores -18.0



            abs()
            - Returns the integer absolute value of any given integer argument
            * The absolute value of any given positive or negative number is the positive version of the number
            - Useful for computing differences in ages, weights, and distances. This is because the difference must always be positive.
            * To printf floating point answers without decimal places, the conversion code inside the string must be '%.0f'.

                E.g.    As mathematic formula the below is True

                        abs(25) == abs(-25) == 25

            
            fabs()
            - Returns the floating-point absolute value of any given integer argument
            * The absolute value of any given positive or negative number is the positive version of the number
            * To printf floating point answers without decimal places, the conversion code inside the string must be '%.0f'.
            
                E.g.    As mathematic formula the below is True

                        fabs(25.0) == fabs(-25.0) == 25.0

                        printf("\nAbsolute value of 25 is %.0f\n", fabs(25.0));
            
    

    MATH FUNCTIONS (Algebraic, Trignometric and Logarithmic)

            pow()
            - Raises a value to a power

                E.g.

                        x = pow(4, 6);  //  Computes to 4096, which becomes the value of the variable x


            sqrt()
            - Returns the square root of a value
            * Cannot compute the square root of a negative number. The fabs() function can be used to convert the value to a positive value before the square root is computed.

                E.g.

                        x = sqrt(25);   //  Computes to 5, which becomes the value assigned to variable x
        

        ! TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

            * Each of these functions require an argument expressed in RADIANS. To supply an argument in degrees, convert degrees to radians with this:


                                    radians = degrees * (3.14159 / 180.0);  //  Supply radians variable to function


            cos(x)
            - Returns the cosine of the angle x

            sin(x)
            - Returns the sine of the angle x

            tan(x)
            - Returns the tangent of the angle x

            acos(x)
            - Returns the arc cosine of the angle x

            asin(x)
            - Returns the arc sine of the angle x

            atan(x)
            - Returns the arc tangent of the angle x
        


        ! LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

            exp(x)
            - Returns 'e', base of the natural logarithim, raised to a power specified by 'x' i.e. (e^x)

            log(x)
            - Returns the natural logarithim, of the argument x, mathematically written as ln(x).
            ! x must be positive

            logâ‹Ž10(x)
            - Returns the Base10 logarithim of the arugment x, mathematically written as log10(x).
            ! x must be positive
